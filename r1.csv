1,Venom,"Large amounts of fun
        ",MacJunegrand,24-Oct-18,Format: Prime Video,5,"Movie critics have a though job, I get it. They have to watch lots of movies and not for pleasure, but as a job. They can't just relax and have fun, they need to sit down and analyze every bit of a movie: script, acting, effects, lighting, music, dialogue, etc. They also have to compare with films of different genres and with the actors and directors previous efforts. There's a lot of work and baggage, and it's understandable when they demand more from a film. On the other hand, this process means they simply don't see films the way the general public does, and this disconnect sometimes means they'll be harsher on a film than they need to be. Sometimes this will be out of handling different expectations, and sometimes, being human as they still are, it'll be out of pure unfairness.In the case of Venom, it seems to be a combination of both. The film seems to be almost universally reviled by critics while almost universally loved by audiences. While being completely fair I'll admit many of the complaints about this movie are completely legitimate, I still believe the treatment is receiving by critics is still preposterously exaggerated. I've ranted about this before, but it seems critics have simply grown accustomed to the Marvel Cinematic Universe's formula, and anything that strays from it in any direction is automatically judged harsher, whether it deserves it or not. And Venom absolutely doesn't. Yes, it's campy. Yes, it doesn't take itself too seriously. Yes, it doesn't have any messages and it doesn't deal with any current socio-political issues. What does Venom offer in place of all that? Simple, primal and unbridled FUN.Venom is the story of Eddie Brock, a reporter who believes in doing the right thing, even by using unconventional methods, and even if it means telling the truth about powerful people. Is because of this that he decides to investigate on a rich industrialist who's secretly kidnapping people and experimenting on them. This gets him in serious trouble, and having no good deed going unpunished, he loses his job, girlfriend and apartment. But when a scientist grows a conscience and tells Brock about the secret experiments the industrialist is doing by merging humans with parasitical sentient goo life form known as ""symbiotes"", he decides to pay a visit and inadvertently becomes host for one of these creatures. Hilarity ensues.The symbiote merging with Eddie calls himself ""Venom"". It's an intelligent creature that needs to feed and has less scruples about killing than Eddie does. With Eddie they form a symbiosis: the alien will augment Eddie's strength, agility and resilience while Eddie provides the alien with sustenance until he can find his companions. Having no choice, since he's being followed by people who want him dead, Eddie complies, but now finds himself bond to a creature that could cause the deaths of millions. Meanwhile, another symbiote named ""Riot"" is traveling the planet in search for the rest, and he has even less respect for other forms of life. Will Eddie be able to control Venom or convince him to join his side or will Venom and Riot unite against humanity?Here's why Venom resonates so much with audiences: the story is simple to follow, the main characters are likable and, unlike other films in recent years, it doesn't try to beat messages into the audience's heads. Expect no attempts at political agendas or social issues; every bit of dialogue is in service of the story or the characters. But the main reason is that both main characters are just really fun to watch. Eddie and Venom form basically a buddy cop movie, with two different personalities clashing and being forced to work together.They're also bloody hilarious. I complain a lot about movies in the MCU using humor as an excuse for plot development, having every character being a snide wise-cracker and ruining legitimately tense moments for the sake of a joke, but this one doesn't fall into those pits. The humor is relegated to Eddie and Venom's relationship, so not all characters feel the same, and tense moments are not punctuated by jokes, so the tension isn't lost.Yes, I'll say that there are a bunch of plot holes and perhaps the story is too overly simplistic for those who expect something more, but if you're willing to just relax and have fun, this movie does the job very well.How does it work as an adaptation? People complained a lot about the movie not being R-Rated and Spider-Man not forming part of the origin story, an I say that those people simply have no idea what they're talking about. Venom has always been goofy in the comics, this isn't a new development, and Spider-Man's involvement is unnecessary, since the character is strong enough to thrive on its own. Yes, having Venom show up in a Spider-Man movie would be benefitial... for Spider-Man's character. But Venom can perfectly work on its own without Spidey. That being said, I would very much like to see the characters clash in the future. We'll have to see, since it's still not clear if Venom and Spider-Man even exist in the same universe yet.Bottom-line: if you're expecting elaborate plots, social messages and/or a serious tone this is the wrong place. But if all you want is fun, Venom will do the job perfectly.

2,Venom,"Nobody channels Eddie Brock / Venom like Tom Hardy. Nobody!
        ",kiwijinxter,12-Oct-18,Format: Blu-ray,5,"As someone who had hundreds of Spider-Man comics when I was younger (I even owned a copy of Amazing Spider-Man #300 featuring the first full appearance of Venom), this is the PERFECT Venom origin story. And when I see Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock, Venom's alter ego, it makes me feel happy, contented and as fuzzy as the symbiote.In the comics, Eddie Brock is a character that is a bit of an outcast, is unsure of himself and gets even more confused (initially) when Venom entered his life, and Tom Hardy channels Eddie Brock to perfection!!! Venom in the comics had some dark-ish humour, and the humour that Venom spouts in the movie is spot on - in fact Venom gets the best one liners. And the biggest laughs from the audience. The movie portrays a beautiful symbiotic relationship between Eddie Brock and Venom, and shows progression in their relationship throughout the movie.The CGI for Venom is also spot on, making him a highly flexible and versatile character with the symbiotic extensions doing some cool stunts. It makes Venom look cool and dangerous at the same time. The pacing is just right, and Tom Hardy's versatility as an actor really stole the show, so much so that this would work even if this was a one man show.And the post-credit sneak preview is ""one to die for"" - I DEFINITELY want to see the next Venom - it'll be CGI carnage...Peeps, forget the previous incarnation of Venom, this is the REAL deal. Possibly the best movie I've seen in 2018 to date. Stuff the stuffy professional critics. They haven't had any clue for the past 25 years and are no longer credible sources for good movies - much like the fake news. Go watch Venom. It's da bomb!

3,Venom,"Tater Tots & Chocolate! It’s THAT good!
        ",Kevin J. Loria,7-Oct-18,Format: Blu-ray,5,"Given SONY meh record in MARVEL I went in with low expectations, but I was totally  impressed with Tom Hardy as the lovable loser Eddie Brock. He was equally delightful as Venom. As a stand-alone film, it holds its own as a good action film, but as a precursor to a series of villains films like: Morbius the Living Vampire, Black Cat, and Kraven the Hunter... it sets up a film universe fill with exciting potential. The CGI wasn’t bad, there was a nice balance of time with Hardy on screen, I was afraid he would be lost in the effects. But as usual Hardy slays it.  And just a footnote a need VENOM demanding Tater Tots  & chocolate as my ringtone asap.

4,Venom,"Amazing movie horrible format
        ",A. Stallworth,21-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,1,"Amazon video is awful.  I paid the $6 extra dollars for the 4K version just to find out prime video won’t stream it in 4K, but only in 1080p, and it a bad 1080p at that.  It’s far inferior video and sound to the iTunes version.  I only bought it in prime for ease of use/streaming on many devices.  Prime needs to serious figure out their awful video apps.  Especially if they’re going to charge people for content that can’t use.  Great movie though.

5,Venom,"What a stinker - easily the wost movie I have ever rented on Amazon and I deeply regret it.
        ",Charles Schoch,20-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,1,"This movie was bad. How bad?  It is the only rental I have memory of where I deeply regret spending the 6 bucks and wish I could take it back.Let's get going with the review.  Let's pretend you went to see a new release of ""Hamlet""  starring a current big name star ...  in fact. Let's go back in time.  Remember when Mel Gibson put out hat new  Hamlet back ... 20 years ago?  Let's pretend that happened.  Only when you went to see Hamlet, Hamlet is not the Prince of Denmark, he's actually Chinese and the movie takes place in 1971 and he is an Astronaut.  You would go ""What the hel is going on here?""  right?  That is the Venom movie.  I'm a *huge* fan of Tom Hardy, but the character isn't Eddie Brock and this isn't Venom.Venom is a bad guy.  Not a ""anti-hero""  not a  ambiguous character that sometimes helps and sometimes does not.  He is a very very bad person.  Eddie Brock is a bad person, the symbiote is a bad space critter - that is one of the reasons they team up against Spider-Man.There is an established  fiction associate with the character.  They didn't make him up, he's been around for 20 years  in stories, which is what  spurred my ""Hamlet"" comparison.  All they seem to have done is buy the like-ness of the character and then kind of went ""Meh"" and just invented a complete new everything for it.The ""complete new everything"" isn't even that great.  Eddie isn't a villain, he's a hero! A reporter every-man who gets smacked down by the corporate ""man"" and his career ruined for seeking the ""truth!""  It's so freaking tired and cliche.  Again - this ain't Hamlet but ... come on.... at least put some effort in.  This smacks of ""we had to make a movie or lose the rights"" to me. A low effort  legal compliance shlock film.The space symbiote is just some self-described ""loser"" from space that likes earth because he isn't such a loser by comparison.  He's like a ...loser superman without the moral framework.  So that sucks and is just bad. It's all so bad.The special effects!  These are pretty bad too, the part's where Mr. Hardy has the symbiote kind of .... composited onto bits of him, like half his face or an arm aren't awful.... there's some serious color issues, but they look ok, the entire effect falls apart when he is full on Venom, which looks terrible.  Whoever did that CG should just hang their head in shame - he looks ridiculous. A man in a rubber suit would look better.The Villian is ... the Indian love-child of Steve Jobs and Elon Musk.  ....I'm completely serious.  It is as absolutely stupid as it sounds.There is a love interest for reasons.... she is basically Pepper Potts from IronMan 3.  Yeah, the bad Iron Man where Pepper gets in a suit. coughHINTcough.Basically this movie is a rodeo of failure that smacks of the studio tossing it out the door with the minimum effort given.  Mr. Hardy does his best, but frankly he hasn't got much to work with.  There was once or twice when the dialog between Brock and the Symbiote made me smirk a little,  but largely it falls flat.Final Thought - Don't go see it. It sounds like it's so bad it is good from this - it isn't.  The movie largely takes itself very seriously (with a very small handful of exceptions)  it is a waste of time, save your money.

6,Venom,"Excellent!
        ",H. Tague,11-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,5,"Been a huge fan of Venom since the 90s and been waiting for a good live action adaptation of him ever since and it's about time! This film doesn't hold back, it hits fast and hard with top notch action and effects, capturing all the visceral and chaotic energy of the comic book character. Venom is a standout among antiheroes, part lovecraftian nightmare abomination and part twisted mad genius of Todd McFarlane and all awesome!Don't let the critics fool you. They don't like comic characters to start with and their minds are blown and burnt on the runaway success of MCU. This is some of Marvel's best material free of social commentary reveling in it's own excellence!

7,Venom,"Not Good
        ",Reginald Thornburton,21-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,1,"As a fan of Marvel and Tom Hardy, I wanted to like this.  It was just so formulaic and juvenile.  Basically the antithesis of Infinity Wars, which was stellar.  I wasn't expecting this to be the Schindler's List of comic book films but come on, it feels like a group of 10 year olds collaborated to write this piece of crap.  I'm guessing the money it made at the box office is indicative of how much people like the character of Venom and were willing to roll the dice on a poorly reviewed film (as was I) because I highly doubt it was from repeat viewings.  This movie is so bad it's ""recent DC films"" bad.

Venom suddenly wants to save Earth because he likes it and because he likes his host.  The acting was bad on all parts.  They tried to make this movie humorous and failed.  This was just a failure of a movie.  Don't pay to watch this movie.

11,Venom,"I Can't Wait For More Sequels
        ",Rich Whitcomb,22-Dec-18,Format: Blu-rayVerified Purchase,5,"Venom is an awesome movie that everyone should add to their Marvel collection.  Tom Hardy makes a much better Eddie Brock than Topher Grace. The one thing that did bother me about Tom Hardy, is that, he reminded me of Nick (Jake Johnson) from that show New Girl.  He seemed to have almost the exact same quarks, antics, and almost talk the same way too.  The picture, sound, special effects, and CGI are absolutely amazing in this movie!  I also think 4k is spoiling me.  Whenever I used to watch movies on DVD and Blu-ray, the dark scenes were always horrible to watch because you could barely see what was going on, but with 4k, the dark scenes are almost perfect when you watch them and you don't have to strain your eyes to figure out what's going on.  I highly recommend this movie to everybody!  I looked at Tom Hardy's profile to see when the next one would be coming out and there isn't any listed yet, but I read he signed on to do several sequels.  I hope everybody enjoys this movie as much as I did.

12,Venom,"Don't get carried away with accuracy
        ",Alex,15-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,5,"I don't have an in depth grasp of the marvel character, so I can't comment on the accuracy of the translation. As a stand alone movie, I think it's fabulous. I like anti-heroes, Spawn has the on the edge stuff too, but Venom does it best. I like that they have the confidence to set up a franchise in the first movie. Usually pioneering movies end in a completed way. If the movie is a success they open a franchise. Here, we get Eddie and Venom in a relatively cooperative state going to meet Carnage.There will always be backlash from fundamentalist fans, but it shouldn't stand in the way of possibility.

        ",Sam Kreutzer,15-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,5,"Rotten Tomatoes gives Venom a 28%, IMDb a 6.9/10 and Metacritic a 35% but I strongly disagree. Tom Hardy is excellent as Eddie Brock and Venom. I'd been wanting to see this movie for a while and lemme tell you, 10/10 would recommend. Venom is hilarious and it makes me think about these 'symbiotes' and their consciousness, where they're not so far off from humans. If you're on the edge about this movie, I think it's great! Dark humor, a plot that's pretty easy to follow and who can go wrong with Tom Hardy?

14,Venom,"Paid reviews aside, a critical look at ""Venom.""
        ",Vargr,13-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,3,"So, ""Venom,"" where do I start? The good? The bad? The ugly (CGI)?How about instead of a structured thesis-style presentation I just stream of conscious my impressions of the movie?The VERY beginning of Venom is actually pretty bland, it's not unlike the beginning of Rampage, ""space, specimens, oh jeez a wreck."" After this segment, Venom actually does a pretty good job at being a low-impact horror-esque film for a little bit. We see a symbiont jumping from one person to the next, levying horror and murder everywhere it goes. I was pretty engaged, thinking to myself ""this is pretty edgy for a marvel film."" Now, the horror elements are neutered, to the point it kind of reminds me of the ""sweat instead of blood"" SNES Mortal Kombat port of old. You will see some people die, a few get eaten, but you won't ""see"" it if you know what I mean?We're then turned to Eddie Brock and given a glimpse into what a narcissistic loser he is for about 20 minutes. You're also treated to the sociopathic ""genius"" head of the facility that owns the spacecraft you saw in the beginning. Somewhere in this mixture you finally get to see the symbiont that will become Venom jump to Brock. I'm going to take a second here to voice my irritation with how simple they make the bonding process look. In the comics, as Venom evolved, the process of the organism bonding with hosts became much more violent. This aspect of the character should have been maintained in this movie, in my opinion. It would feel much more visceral if you saw images of these ""symbiotes"" somewhat violently forcing themselves on their hosts than the ""oh I've spilled some grape juice on my shirt aaaaaaand it's gone"" kind of effect they went with.For the sake of this review I'll separate Venom into three acts, Eddie merging with the symbiont marks the end of act one. At this point in the movie, there is an abrupt change in tone. It goes from this tame horror style that it established, to a comedy. It's not a smooth transition either, Eddie is walking down the street after escaping the lab, a gravelly voice starts talking to him. There is little time spent studying the bonding process between symbiont and man, there is little time spent showing the symbiont digging into who Eddie is as a person, and there is little time spent explaining or even really discussing the physiological symptoms they describe as byproducts of the union between man and alien. They actually never address this to a point I am comfortable with. In the scene where a doctor describes to Eddie that the symbiont is harming him, potentially even dooming him, they never make a point of explaining how the symbiont is in fact a ""symbiote"" and not a ""parasite"" by definition. At the end of act 2, the movie again abruptly changes pace by ending this comedic stretch it establishes and turning somewhat dark again, as Venom explains that under no uncertain circumstances, it's goal is domination and eradication of the human species, and then earth. Venom even taunts Brock at one point, ""You’re a loser.""The movie lost my attention somewhat around this point, so I may have missed something in the third act, which is where the stereotypical ""redemption and boss battle"" sequence plays in. This is where I really developed some gripes with the CGI, it's pretty lackluster in the beginning, the big ""Venom reveal"" was undercut by just how bad Venom looks, in my opinion at least, maybe you'll be easier on the visuals. Actually, ""bad"" may be a poor choice of word, ""cheap"" is a more accurate term in my mind. He looks ""shiny"" and unrefined, it reminds of 10 year old almost top of the line CGI. The visuals are really unimpressive.From here, we follow Eddie and Venom as become fast friends and eventually fight the other symbiont that's been roaming freely since the beginning of the movie. The final showdown feels like it was meant to be really epic, yet it didn't even keep my eyes on the screen. I actually started playing FFT WOTL on my phone when Eddie made a statement something to the effect of ""I had an alien in my @$$."" The movie eventually ends with a pretty stereotypical death for the main antagonist, and you're then thrust onto Eddie's shoulder as he walks into a prison to interview a serial killer. I did smile when I saw Woody Harrelson's face, that smile turned a furrowed frown with the closing line of the film... ""When I get out of here, and I will... There WILL be... CARNAGE.""I heard Stan and Kyle from Southpark in the back of my head... ""Oh f*** you.""In the end, I'm left with this as an impression... Venom could have been a really good movie. I do understand they /have/ to tie him into the larger Marvel Comics Cinematic Universe at some point, so I get that they needed to present a product tame enough for a wide audience, from their perspectives at least. However, in my opinion, which is worth what it cost you... They could have simply done Venom right as a stand-alone movie, included all the necessary horror and violence elements in full swing, while providing a final act that ran a compelling change of heart on Venom's side, and really still been perfectly set to have him appear in more kid friendly films without much adjustment.So while Venom isn't really a ""bad movie,"" it's a really average film with a great leading man, if it wasn't for Tom Hardy's general affability, the film would have had zero charisma (which was a better movie). I just didn't really find the movie ""likeable,"" I'll watch it again over the weekend with my wife and a few beers, maybe that will improve the experience, but I doubt it.

Perhaps a low budget movie was going to unfold before my eyes with really one good actor, and that is Tom Hardy, and even his acting was a bit troubling.  However, as the plot unfolded, the action and the acting picked up quickly leading to a movie in which I had to stay tuned to every minute, lest I would miss something vital to the overall performance.  The movie quickly grew on me and I found myself embracing the alien, Venom. and his partner, Tom Hardy, as both of them teamed up to destroy evil for the greater good of the earth. I won't spoil the plot, and keep in mind that this is a Marvel Universe film, not an epic masterpiece like Gone With The Wind, but perhaps just as important when it comes to saving the Earth from an Alien Invasion.  If you love Marvel movies, then you will enjoy this one, and perhaps you'll want to get your own symbiont, and fight crime to feed the beast.

This is even more frustrating because the first actual Venom transformation isn't until the 1 hour mark, so the movie is basically an hour of build-up and then 30 minutes of action.

        ",K. Borah,18-Jan-19,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,4,"The story suffers from what I now call Stan Lee Syndrome or Origins disease. Seems Marvel can't write a script without bogging it down with origins and this plight as infected several other media presentations of late... Think about the excessive flash backing in almost every TV show or spending needless story time making sure we know way more then we need to know about why someone is the way they are. Be that has it may, this film survives, not by it's creative storytelling by any stretch of the imagination or lack there of but by it's strong casting. Mainly Tom Hardy, the titular character who is able to bring a refreshing grounded quality in portraying his plight to understand and comprehend the strange things that are happening to him. Michelle Williams is a bright star who deserves more screen time then she is given here. By the time the credits role you are left wondering why they did not let us know more about her then we were allowed to enjoy. Overall, seeing this film on its first viewing prompted me to see it again (something few films have accomplished since LOTR) says a great deal about it's watch-ability. Die hard fans seem to complain that the Venom character is toned down too much from its comic book persona and I can understand why this would be an issue. It seems this would have been better served has a Hard R action fest then a over produced Saturday matinee extravaganza that it has become, but it still manages to entertain just for performances if not the story or the lack thereof.

        ",jason guion,23-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,4,"Before watching it I saw a review on YouTube savaging this movie. The guy made a high production value and very long video decrying so called dual prologues, confusing time jumps...but I rented anyway. I really enjoyed it, and I feel sorry for anyone who was unable to go into a movie understanding it comes from a comic book, and wasn’t supposed to touch nerves the way Saving Private Ryan does. Tom Hardy is a great actor of our time in my opinion. Roles like his homeless Stuart, as scary London gangsters, all the way to roles as a good guy with a sweet disposition are all great to watch, and he does a great job here of being kind but tough good man with a broken heart trying to do good, while doing an excellent job having to pretend that there is a whole other living personality inside him deciding to move in permanently, knowing everything it’s host knows and feels. The review said the effects were average, but they were as good as any, and the story is fast, and funny with great thought out action sequences. Who doesn’t love Steve Mcqueen inventing the car chase, and then doesn’t enjoy a kick butt chase here as well. Everyone did a great job acting, and the there are only really one time jump, and it is simply forward. If that is confusing, or you came for some never before seen special effects as your motivation instead of the Venom comic world and story in it then go see something else. This was fun and I hope Tom Hardy and the others do some more movies very soon. And that Hardy pops that guy in the nose once, for actually putting the dictionary definition of prologue on the screen in his review as though it is some special knowledge no one else understands!

There are many reasons why this movie is not very good - the plot is laughable, the CG goes from pretty decent to horrible. For Marvel-fans, it pretty much destroys any continuity from the comic books. With these negatives, the review should be 1 - 2 stars but I am giving Venom three stars for one reason: Tom Hardy. His presence anchors Venom in a way that makes all the criticism fall away. His performance is the best thing about the movie and elevates it into a respectable movie. He makes you sympathetic to Eddie Brock, an anti-hero with very few redeemable qualities. What helps elevate his performance is that Eddie doesn't really become a hero....he is still on the line between hero and villain at the end of the movie (I will leave it up to fellow viewers to determine which side of the line).Venom is still not a good movie but it is far from the debacle that everyone suspected before its release. I am cautiously optimistic about the inevitable sequel.Mild Recommend.

        ",mcteenie,19-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,3,"The odd part of this movie is that I feel like despite the first third of it grinding on forever setting up Eddie Brock and his foes that the plot and characters are 2 dimensional and cliche.  Near the end, everyone's motivations seemingly come out of nowhere (and don't benefit from all the meandering plot building in the establishing act) and there's zero reason you'd imagine anyone to be doing whatever they're doing.  If cut and paced better, maybe this wouldn't annoy me so much and the film would warrant more than one viewing.  Others have pointed out that it does feel like a throwback to 90s superhero/action films (for better or worse) and I'll definitely agree with that.I think all the actors (who are otherwise phenomenal) are wasted in this.  Tom Hardy meanders through like an unlikeable drunk which may have been the point.  The cast is great, but they presumably did their best with the script they were given.Overall, I had fun watching this.  Venom (the character) was great and when things finally started happening it was a fun ride.  Venom interacting with Eddie came off as hokey at first, but was pretty funny once I stopped framing the movie in my head as a ""serious"" super hero movie.I'm confused as to why Sony made this film; now that Spider Man is in the other Marvel universe and was very conspicuously absent , it leaves out a big part of Venom's story and origin.  Even in the unlikely event that Venom made the jump to that universe, he's coming over more or less fully formed and it would be weird to retcon his origin and hatred of Spider Man to use his character the way comic fans would expect.Superhero films have come a long way, but I think a lot of us have lost track of the fact that super powered people in costumes and alien symbiotes are pretty ridiculous when you think about it.  Maybe Venom could have been a better developed film, but it's an alien parasite that eats people and riffs with Tom Hardy's character.  If you aren't expecting The Dark Night or something that is faithful to the comics Venom can be fun.

But nope, it was just riot vs venom. The others were no where to be found towards the end of the movie. It does however make you think though as to what happens to the others, maybe one of them is carnage looking for a new host (Cletus)??? Who knows??? All I know is that this movie is still a fun ride. The action was awesome and Venom looked very cool. The cg of venom was kind of bad at times, and yet other times it looked good which was weird. It felt like some scenes the cgi was done differently by different people, which explains why at times Venom looks great and then a little fake the next shot.

Once people who are so stuck up understand there is a multiverse full of different versions of the character, they can just drop it and let others enjoy another perspective.

        ",Review,29-Dec-18,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,4,"Venom is a commendable divergence by Marvel away from mythology and the uni-dimensional superhero characters of the recent past into a more complex territory of science fiction. Some might call Venom a kind of an optimistic update to the 1978 classic Scifi film ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers"", but with many twists.  Tom Hardy brings a comic and subtly self-deprecating dimension into the fold that works very well in his portrayal of Eddie Brock, a journalist with a conscience and Michelle Williams is wonderful as Anne Weying, Eddie's ex-fiancee and a San Francisco district attorney. It is somehow too easy to give too much of this film away by discussing it. Suffice it to say that it is entertaining and worth a look, especially if you have been burned out by too many run of the mill superhero films.

While I do think that Tom Hardy was good as Eddie Brock and the design of the symbiotes are pretty cool, especially that slow-mo freeze framing of Venom and Riot fighting with Eddie and Drake fighting along with them (someone should win an award for that scene), I do think that the movie as a whole is a little erratic. Venom himself doesn't appear on screen until the end of the first hour of the movie, although it was pretty glorious when he did. The action and effects were pretty good, although there were times that I couldn't tell what was happening because everything was going too fast. I am a bit disappointed that Spider-Man was not in, or even mentioned in this movie; since, you know, he is a BIG PART OF VENOM'S CREATION! Seriously, how is this a Venom origin story without Spider-Man? I do like the chemistry between Eddie and Venom. What? It's better than that unnecessary romantic subplot with Eddie and his ex-girlfriend. They're like Jekyll and Hyde, if Jekyll was trying to keep Hyde from eating people and end up as total bros.

They move magically through clothes to take form instead of through the skin like they should.3. There is almost no explanation for why venom helps Eddie except that on Venom's planet he is apparently a ""loser"" as well, subjected to some form of socialization on his planet which seems ridiculous because they need a host to live on earth but on its own planet it's basically a moving blob.4. The symbiotic creatures already have a mind of their own and seem to understand everything going on around them even prior to any human interaction.5. They also claim to know everything about the host, but yet still don't know many things that would seem obvious if it could read the hosts mind.6. The plot never makes you care about Eddie or any of the symbiotic creatures at all.  The entire cast could have died and nobody would have shed a tear.  No character development outside of some fluffy, surface layer type things.Why re-write Venom?  The original story was a MUCH better story than this weird alien sub-culture movie that you see here.

Personally, I remember Venom not from the Lethal Protector storyline, so I can relate to people who thought it out of place to see Venom with no relation to Spiderman. Even ignoring that, it was a pretty poorly constructed film.It should have been R-rated. Yep, it really should have been. Venom comics (and a lot of comics, believe it or not) contain a fair amount of blood and violence. Venom is a dark, horrifying character, and the PG-13 rating -- along with the nature of the story and overall writing -- turned him into something about as scary as Smaug from The Hobbit. Like, maybe scary to a 7 year old.Venom should have been an uncomfortable, visceral experience; taunting us to eventually cheer for a murderous alien psychopath -- along with the slimy, self-serving human being he merges with -- who happens to be slightly less murderous than his alien comrades.Also, the CGI and actually the basic design of Venom was pretty bad. It looked more like half-assed claymation than anything else. Also, it reeks of standalone, setting it apart from one of the factors that have made the MCU and the entirety of the comic book universe so successful: crossovers! It's like the creators of this film learned nothing from the mistakes of the early 2000s comic adaptations.Sure, I guess it's ""fun,"" and some people are apologetically calling it ""average.""

        ",ManiacalSpark,19-Jan-19,Format: DVDVerified Purchase,1,"Ultimately Venom is just a disappointment. Tom Hardy can't carry the film as much as it tries to make him, and it's very clear that they got halfway through the movie before realizing they needed an antagonist. A interesting first half of the movie suddenly rushes to a close and forces a terrible bad guy in your face for one of the WORST movie boss fights I have ever seen.Like I'll be honest, I was expecting a bad movie from this, but one of those 'so bad it's good' bad movies. Instead we just get this disappointing mess of a film that rushes to an unsatisfying conclusion.

        ",thephotopeddler,3-Mar-19,Format: Prime VideoVerified Purchase,4,"Venom is one of my favorite Marvel characters and while this isn't the Venom movie I personally wanted it was still entertaining. The CGI and motion capture was fun from an animation standpoint, and I appreciate Hardy's playful banter with Venom even if it becomes trying at times. If Sony and Disney allow it, there could be a world in which this version of Venom meshes well with the MCU Spiderman, Holland. The real crime of this Venom film is the wig they put on Michelle Williams. She played her part well, but the hair was just too distracting. Riz Ahmed plays the villain well, and we get several nods to the Venom universe that could unfold in future movies. I appreciate the attempt at a general audience Venom film, but I personally want to see this IP get the R tag and go deep into the darkness. Would like this to feel more Deadpool in audience and less Thor Ragnarok in humor. Bottom line, I was entertained and always fun to see your favorite characters come to life even if the plot doesn't hold.

I would daydream while thumbing through my comic books and would often miss certain dialogues and conversations as I was transported into the comic and part of the action.Venom took me back to my childhood although like most movies try to modernize and alter the story for commercial and audience familiarity. As the Venom story was being introduced I was starting to discover video games and didn't follow the whole symbiote storyline. Fast forward to today and I will admit that while some of the storyline is entertaining and looks great visually it is not the story that I remember (insert wiper snapper comment here).

I think the first 20 minutes is a waste of time and only after Tom Hardy gets Venom does he get actual acting work to do (which he is great at as always), but everything aside from the special effects and Hardy were troublesome.  In an age where Avengers Infinity War came out months before this as the high mark of comicbook movies, this was a huge step BACK to the time when Daredevil and Elektra were the big movie flops.  Like they learned nothing from Deadpool or Thor Ragnarok.  Riz Ahmed was decent as the villian, he had this slimmy way about him, but there wasn't enough for him to shine.  All in all, the best scene is the one after the credits and that set up for Venom 2 is the only real reason to watch this.  Still, I bought it because of the 4k value of the cgi.

64,Venom,"Ouch.
        ",Micah,27-Oct-18,Format: DVD,2,"It's not as bad as an MCU film, but it looks like Sony intends to head in that direction.This movie feels generic from beginning to end despite that it's centered around some of my favorite comic book characters. It takes SOME ideas from the comics and tries to iterate them somewhat seriously (unlike disneymarvel), but it still likes to throw in some ""haha, it's awkward and/or this really cool character is a failure right now"" jokes, and it makes me sick.As for its regard to the source material, they completely miss the mark with Eddie. They didn't even TRY. This is the first time anyone has tried to make Eddie a complete wuss rather than a sleazy guy with decent goals. He also doesn't have anyone who so personally ruins his life in the film, so the suit has no actual reason to cling to Eddie, let alone call him a good host. There are no rules for what qualifies him as a good host. Symbiotes don't need to feed on anger or hatred, I guess. Not only does this ruin the logic of the movie and spit on the comics (and the intelligence of the audience, while we're at it), but it also completely nullifies the line, ""we are Venom.""Even throughout the film, anyone who says the name ""Venom"" is not referring to Eddie and the symbiote. They're referring specifically to the symbiote. Spider-Man in the suit isn't Venom. Mac Gargon in the suit isn't Venom. Way to absolutely destroy the best part about the character. For that matter, there's even the line ""I am Venom"" in the movie!Riot was poorly executed as well. He's never been a team leader (unless there's a comic about that I'm not aware of; I don't keep up with him in particular). However, Riot does not have a pronounced snout like this film portrays. To make it worse, no Klyntar has ever clung to Carlton despite his complete fascination with them. To make it WORSE, he's played by a middle-eastern youth. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind the inclusion of several races and all, but why don't companies make new characters and stories to do it with? That's like making a a new Sonic the Hedgehog game, but Sonic's green and Tails is purple. The goal of cinematic adaptation is to do just that: adapt the characters and concepts to cinema.One thing the film sorta gets right is that the Venom Klyntar was an outcast from his race, but the movie doesn't go anywhere with it, and it manages to screw up details. Instead of explaining that he's actually deemed insane because he wanted to assist hosts rather than consume them, ""I'm kind of a loser."" Really? That's like making Peter Parker wear the mask for kicks instead of protecting people he knows.Lastly, I must say it's an odd choice to have Woody Harrelson play Cletus Kassady. It's not really BAD, but it's about as fitting for the role as Tom Hardy for Eddie Brock.The only REALLY FUN parts of this movie revolve pretty much entirely around Venom himself. It's fun to watch the unique changes in his maneuvers using the wet and sticky physics or pouncing around like an angry, wild, reckless Spider-Man. That's what Venom really should be. Come to think of it, Sony has a bit of a history with getting the action scenes right. They actually make use of a character's traits and allow the character to think based on those traits, and while some other companies do it from time to time, Sony is almost always consistent with it.Eminem tried to destroy the movie, but frankly, I don't think it needed his help.All in all, this movie left me very confused. Riot, Carlton, Anne, and a handful of other concepts in this are all oddly aware of what the comics are like, but the story it tells is detached and not as engaging as it could have been. It feels like a small struggle (but not small enough to be personal, like Venom's grudge with Spider-Man seen anywhere except in Venom's own movie), and you get the happy ending you expected. Worth watching? Ehhhhhh. If you can appreciate some awesome physics being applied to an awesome design in the wrong story, then yeah, it's worth watching. I can't say enough that the visuals and sounds in this movie are SO MUCH FUN, but they deserve more respect and better writing.

        ",N / A,1-Mar-19,Format: Blu-rayVerified Purchase,3,"An origin story for an iconic character such as Venom easily aroused major interest in the comic book adaptation furor of the modern age. However, that furor should've dissolved by the announcement of its creative team rather than a trailer or PG-13 rating. The director & writers of Venom are responsible for Gangster Squad, The 5th Wave, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, The Dark Tower and Fifty Shades of Grey. If you think that combination would produce another The Dark Knight (2008), The Avengers (2012) or Logan (2017), you were self-deluded (or not paying attention).Venom should've been an unmitigated disaster. However, if one is able to discard all expectation or notion of what a Venom adaptation should be, you might be able to get sucked into the entertainingly vacuous spectacle of it all, which was replete with humor and unapologetic bombast that even at its height feels more measured and considered than the third act of any recent D.C. Extended Universe film where everything descends into people throwing large objects at each other.Venom is not a great film, but its also quite harmless. It sought to be entertaining rather than thoughtful, and achieved that very result. It may be a disappointment to fans wanting a faithful adaptation but as I said before, that expectation should've been dropped upon learning who the director and screenwriters were.

I cannot get enough of the dialogue between Venom and Eddie because it allows the audience to see the inner thoughts of a hero like no other action film has access to.I could have used a more evil Carlton Drake.

Riz Ahmed- Good character, but too much talking, not enough expressive through acting. Almost had it  , but many scenes weren't timed correctly and it appeared not in sync ( between the story line and the actual camera time)..But I did like him as the character, but he needed to be darker(depth).3.

Transition of evil creature from evil creature to sort of good creature did not play well at all. There was no lead in no explanation nothing. Which made the movie from that point on pretty foolish.

        ",HolyJIEbus,7-Oct-18,Format: Prime Video,4,"Comic Book Movie Non-spoiler Review (7.5/10)VenomDirector: Ruben FleischerWriters: Jeff Pinkner, Scott RosenbergStarring: Tom Hardy (Eddie Brock/Venom), Michelle Williams (Anne Weying), Riz Ahmed (Carlton Drake), Jenny Slate (Dr. Dora Skirth)Plot: The Life Foundation CEO Carlton Drake has discovered a new life form: the symbiote! This parasytic symbiote fuses with San Francisco based renowned journalist Eddie Brock and Drake wants his property back - no matter what he has to do or who he has to kill...Review: I am a fan of the Venom character and I have read his comics, bought his action figures, and even played video games with him as a playable character in ""Maximum Carnage"" and ""Separation Anxiety"" on the SNES. With that being said I would have been happy with him just being portrayed better than the Venom in ""Spider-Man 3"" (2007); and I am happy to say that Hardy knocks it out of the park and then some with this movie despite its flaws. Once Brock gets the symbiote, the move becomes a no holds barred visceral action movie with savage action scenes. Although the movie is rated PG-13, it has a high body count and pushes the rating to the limit. This movie even had elements of body horror and horror genre elements that made the movie creepy enough to give it an edge and tone that made it stand out compared to other super hero movies. Hardy's schizophrenic interactions with the Venom symbiote was also a great treat that gave the movie some comedic moments as well as some weight to the plot as I came to appreciate their relationship. Essentially, Hardy played a hapless reporter who was at the wrong place and wrong time, and who must now deal with the consequences of his actions as well as the homicidal symbiote that gave him the power to protect himself and those around him. With that being said the majority of the weaknesses of the film plagued the movie before Brock came into contact with the symbiote. Drake was a one note mustache twirling villain. I never bought the fact that Weying and Brock were a couple who were about to tie the knot, and Williams and Hardy had no real chemistry and their relationship felt forced. It felt like the movie was spending too much time telling me Brock and Weying loved each other rather than showing me that they loved each other. Also, one could tell that the producers were trying to delay Brock from getting the symbiote as last as possible to compensate for their budget. Special effects cost alot of money and although Venom looked good, there wasn't enough of him in the movie and it showed. A high speed chase with lots of special effects? Brock will run away from his pursuers, but only use the powers of Venom without him turning into Venom. Venom needs to get away and dive into the ocean? Then lets have him turn into Brock as soon as he pops out of the ocean. Shortcuts like these were apparent to me to keep the budget of the movie as low as possible. Hopefully, if this movie succeeds the studio will authorize a bigger budget and let the creators go crazy the Venom special effects in a subsequent sequel. Depsite the movie's shortcomings, it was a fun ride and the special effects that it incorporated were top notch. I already watched it twice in IMAX so you know I enjoyed it. Would I say that it's one of the best super hero movies ever made? Nope. Or even one of the movies of the year? Nope, but I had fun watching it and if you're a fan of the Venom character or super hero movies, I think that this was a nice variation of the genre.

Venom--an authentic alien name we have to take for granted--has the voice of prostate cancer: sometimes English and intelligent, sometimes American and stupid, sometimes childish, sometimes animalistic, ALWAYS ridiculous.The violence is toned down to pre-school level.  No blood.  No gore.  Nothing to fear.The CGI battles are annoying, seizure-inducing, and childlike.  And there are a lot of them.The CGI that springs from Eddie Brock throughout the movie often does not look real or aligned properly with the actor.  When Brock talks face to face with the symbiote, it's obvious that the actor is looking elsewhere.  Really amateur mistake.Furthermore, the main character (Brock) initiates basically nothing.  Venom is the Deus Ex Machina, saving him all the time.  So, the story is boring.The antagonist is a wimpy Indian kid who is supposed to be an evil Elon Musk.  Then, in Act 3 he merges with another symbiote with a terribly childish name.  We have no reason to fear him.  We have no reason to fear the aliens.  We are given no information on the dorky Indian Elon Musk or the symbiotes.  Just that they need hosts to live on Earth.  Well, woop-dee-doo.Then the obligatory love story is so stupid, rapid, and unbelievable that you will feel like the movie has a genuine metaphorical tumor.  The destroyed love subplot is literally a TOOL the writers use to get a doctor into the story and show us that Venom hates MRI scans.Venom begins the movie as a monster, then evolves into a parasitic invader, then devolves into a comedic alter ego, then becomes Brock's buddy.  For no reason.  No. Reason.The movie is a shining example of how to ruin a fantastic comic book villain.

1803,Venom,"trippy black ooze
        ",H. Bala,7-Oct-18,Format: Prime Video,3,"Watching VENOM is like stepping into a time machine, and that could be taken as a compliment or a dis. VENOM is a throwback to the campy aesthetic of superhero movies circa 1990s, before Nolan and the MCU and WONDER WOMAN made superhero movies a viable, critically acclaimed thing. With that said, VENOM is not as trash as most critics have said. It's far from a good movie, but it has bits that are wildly entertaining. I laughed a lot, although, okay, some of the humor comes unintentionally because of the way the movie was cut. There's a scene in which two people are talking, and, in the background, you see an extra put a hand to his face, like he's just done with this. My theater audience got a good chuckle out of that.I'm not one of those Lady Gaga fanatics crapping on this movie to uplift her movie. But I say Sony goofed again. VENOM suffers from studio interference, from extensive reshoots and choppy editing, and a bonehead script. The scene transitions are awful. And it isn't until around the 45 minute mark that our toothy anti-hero shows up, 45 minutes during which I found myself drifting and chafing for the plot to move along already. I give no sh-ts about the Life Foundation. Michelle Williams, who can act her ass off, is wasted.It's an origin story that deviates drastically from the source material. The most glaring swerve is the absence of Spidey. Note that Sony opted for a PG-13 rating because the plan is to have Spider-Man meet Venom somewhere down the pipe, and I guess you can't have the wallcrawler popping up in an R-rated flick.Still, the demotion to PG-13 doesn't hurt the movie as much as I'd thought. When Venom gets to wrecking sh-- up, it's all good. For those who were wondering, yessir, Venom does get to eat people. The body count is impressive. The violence teeters on the visceral.The best part is the dynamics between Eddie Brock and Venom. I'm shocked that there is actual progression in their relationship, that the both of them snag solid character work. Tom Hardy is one hell of a quirky performer. In the comics, I didn't give a what about loser reporter Eddie Brock. And I still don't. But Hardy does some interesting things. Venom is appropriately odd and deranged. I appreciate that, at times, the film achieves a classic body horror vibe.The ending is a letdown, but isn't that the case with superhero cinema, mostly? Even WONDER WOMAN, 99% a terrific movie, presents a final battle that is CG-heavy and is visually impersonal and just meh. It's a toss-up whether you'll like this movie. Do you like the aesthetics of '90s throwbacks like SPAWN, or THE PHANTOM, THE SHADOW, DARKMAN or Affleck's DAREDEVIL? What kind of sense of humor do you have? Are you a stickler for the source material? I thought Jenny Slate was decent as a scientist. I thought the bad guy was crap. It's a sloppy, campy mess, and some people are into that like they are into train wrecks.There are two end credit stingers. First one sets up the plot for a possible sequel (but I'm not okay with who was cast in the role of--). The second stinger should be called ""Meanwhile, in a good film..."" It's an extended scene for SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDERVERSE that runs three and a half minutes and got me even more stoked for its Christmas release date.Sony is so desperate about creating its own viable corner of the shared Marvel universe, it doesn't mind scraping the bottom of the barrel. I dunno about the IPs it's trying to bring to the screen. I hear they're making a MORBIUS THE LIVING VAMPIRE movie, a KRAVEN THE HUNTER movie, and a SILVER & BLACK movie (which would feature Silver Sable and Black Cat). What's next? A solo film starring the Spot? What about Frog-Man? Stilt-Man? Hypno-Hustler and his Mercy Killers? Aunt May the Movie?

        ",William Hefner,16-Dec-18,Format: Prime Video,2,"I'm really surprised that this movie was ever released and not in a good way. This movie had one of the most uneven, badly written scripts that I have ever had to sit through. The pacing is outright horrible. Like it was written by someone with ADD. The CGI was so overwhelmingly annoying that it made my skin crawl.From what I have read it seems that this film was not only the result of a really bad screenplay but was pretty much butchered in the editing process. It seemed as if there were large gaps in the story line that just didn't make much sense and the whole film just seemed kind of incomplete.Then there's the confusing back-and-forth mix of what at times seems like your average Marvel Comic Universe story and when it begins to delve into the R-Rated format of the Deadpool films. This movie can't really seem to figure out what universe it fits into and as a result seems choppy and uneven.Tom Hardy's role is played so over the top that it is pretty much a parody of itself. I have no idea what the director was thinking in this case. He just made the character end up being so unbelievable that you couldn't really sympathize with him or take the plot seriously. I know that the film is based on a comic book, but in reality comic books are not nearly this cheesy.The film definitely had some amusing moments. It was mildly entertaining, but not something that I would ever want to watch again. I've seen many of the Marvel movies several times and still find them enjoyable. Honestly, I didn't really want to sit through all of this movie the first time I watched it, but I have this annoying habit of watching films to the end no matter how bad they are. This once I very nearly ended up turning off.

Let's put it this way, if the 4 and 5 star reviews aren't fake, just to manipulate people into spending their money, then the reviewers are brain dead morons that no one should ever listen to anyway. Venom is extremely slow to develope the character, there is very little action and what little action there is barely entertains. Everything about the movie feels low budget, the dialogue is cheesy and repetitive, the storyline has tons of gaps and unanswered questions. There's nothing new or memorable about the action scenes, venom is like a cross between the Hulk and the Dr Strange cape. On the one hand Venom does as he pleases with no regard for subtlety and at the same time he protects his host from unforseen dangers. But like I said nothing he does is new, we've seen it all before. This is Venoms fault, this is the writers/directors fault. This is without a doubt the absolute worst Marvel movie made so far. Why the franchise invests so much time and effort into making some of the movies amazing and then allows mediocre movies like this to be made completely baffles me.

1809,Venom,"He has a parasite
        ",E. A. Solinas,22-Oct-18,Format: DVD,3,"Ah, Venom. One of the most popular antiheroes of the Marvel world - a toothy, oily alien symbiotic creature bonded to a human being.And despite the fact that Spider-Man is currently grazing in Marvel pastures, Sony went right ahead and created a movie revolving around this character. ""Venom"" is not a particularly good movie - the first third or so is rather dull, actually - but there's a certain manic, bizarre charm to the overall story that makes it at least interesting to watch. If nothing else, watch it for Tom Hardy's continuously strange performance - the man acts like he's suffering from a case of the flu medicated with Jagermeister.Eddie Brock (Hardy) is a determined journalist out to expose the Life Foundation and its CEO, the Elon-Musk-like Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed). What he doesn't know is that Drake's space exploration ventures have brought a number of goopy alien organisms to Earth, and one of them has escaped. After Brock's attempts to expose Drake leads to him losing his job and his fiancee (Michelle Williams), he's contacted by a scientist who promises to show him something truly terrible.But when he tries to free a woman from a Life Foundation lab, a black goo merges with his body. He starts feeling and acting strangely, and hearing a voice inside his head. Oh, and tentacles sprout from his body.Yes, one of the alien symbiotes has bonded with him, and Eddie quickly discovers that Venom will take deadly action to avoid being captured by Carlton's thugs... and often just because it thinks mayhem is fun. Unfortunately, Carlton is still looking for the two, and... well, remember that lost symbiote who escaped from him? It's back, and bad things are starting to happen because of it. It will take both Eddie and Venom to save the Earth.Let's be clear: ""Venom"" is not a good movie. It's hokey, full of hoary old cliches and has major consistency issues that go blithely unaddressed (supposedly symbiotes are only compatible with certain people... yet one of them hops merrily from person to person with no problem). But it's almost so bad that it's good, because it has some truly baffling creative choices and performances, and becomes weirdly entertaining when the titular symbiote enters the story.In all honesty, the first part of ""Venom"" is pretty dull - it's mostly Eddie bumbling around San Francisco and reflecting on his bad decisions, interspersed with Carlton being sinister and egomaniacal as he tries to successfully merge a human and symbiote. Things start getting interesting when Eddie gets gooped, and starts doing things like leaping into lobster tanks to eat raw crustaceans - I'm not sure if wacky black comedy was what director Ruben Fleischer was going for, but he achieved it.From there onward, it becomes somewhat more interesting with skull-cracking fights, tentacle-filled motorcycle rides, SWAT team attacks, and some baffling writing that never quite makes sense (Eddie refers to Venom as being ""up my [butt]""). Most importantly, it becomes a sort of odd-couple movie in which Brock and Venom constantly play off one another, with Venom as the mocking head-biting carnivore whom Brock is trying to keep in check (""No, we do not eat policemen!""), and who is inexplicably won over to the good side by Eddie's... um... something. He's also very invested in Eddie getting back together with Anne.Tom Hardy's performance in this movie is... utterly fascinating to me. He looks unkept and slightly glassy-eyed, and plays Eddie Brock with a strange lack of direction and a rambling speaking manner, almost as if he's making up his dialogue as he goes along (""My legs were broken, and now they're not broken""). It's like he has mild food-poisoning and is mildly drunk, and trying to act through both. This might be more understandable if this was only how he acted after joining with the symbiote, but... nope. He's like this throughout the whole movie. It's almost mesmerizing how weird he is.And his weirdness is actually kind of welcome beside the other characters, who tend to be a lot less compelling. Williams is utterly stock as the exasperated ""normal"" ex-girlfriend alienated by Eddie's Srs Journalism, but who still cares about him, and Jenny Slate is vaguely nervy and twitchy in every line she utters. And Ahmed is so transparently, relentlessly evil that he's nearly fun to watch in his two-dimensional mustache-twirling villainy; you half expect him to tie Williams to the railroad tracks and set fire to an orphanage.It's predictable, it's cliched, but ""Venom"" has some eccentric creative choices that are ultimately fun in a perverse way - if nothing else, watch it for the toothy symbiote and his obsession with head-biting.

The chemistry between him and Venom, an alien symbiote, is surprisingly good considering that half the time Venom is just a voice in Brock's head. Heck, the inhuman, cannibalistic creature is rather charming and funny.Venom looks great too. I was worried, because the original comic design wasn't the easiest thing to adapt to live-action, but they really nailed it here. Venom is this 'roided goo creature with a shark mouth and he looks great. The action is inventive. Director Ruben Fleischer has a good eye for scenery and lighting; there's one scene in the woods that is particularly well-shot.On the other hand, the film waits far too long to introduce Venom. There were a lot of parts that could've been cut or shortened. The main villain is super-weak, both in performance, dialogue, and general competence. Justice League's Steppenwolf, Thor: the Dark World's Malekith, and X-Men's Apocalypse were all stronger villains that this. Jenny Slate as a scientist is given nothing but trash dialogue. Whenever the scene is on these two, you're desperately wishing they'd go back to Brock.This is isn't a perfect film, but I walked in expecting to be entertained and I was.P.S. Be sure to stay through all the credits.

When Eddie meets his ex-fiancees new love interest, the new guy is a really genuine person who is polite to eddie and willing to help him when Eddie starts losing control.  A very fresh departure from typical movie tropes.But, THE MOVIE IS TOO SHORT !!!!!  That is the main complaint.  It needed several more scenes of Eddie and Venom together.  Could just be them fighting randos on the street, but it needed more bonding moments between Eddie and Venom so that the line where Venom tells eddie that he's the reason he wants to stay on Earth would have had more impact as you'd have more time to see the character grow from just wanting to invade Earth with Riot.

So when I say that there wasn’t anything redeemable about this movie, it spoke volumes to the people that know me. I’ll never watch this movie again. I couldn’t believe that a script was written and approved. There are amazing actors like Tom Hardy and Michelle Williams in this movie, but even they delivered a poor performance. Awful movie. Thank goodness Sony will probably sell to Marvel within a few years and they can finally do Venom justice.

1816,Venom,"Not edgy or dark or anti-hero enough--just an average superhero movie
        ",Joseph M. Reninger,15-Mar-19,Format: DVD,3,"Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is a no-nonsense reporter who likes to uncover corruption and malfeasance. His publisher wants him to do a light piece on Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), a major inventor in pharmaceuticals and space travel. Eddie uncovers some untoward experiments that Drake's company runs, including the use of homeless people in medical testing. When Eddie confronts Drake, Drake ruins Eddie's career. Eddie got some key information from his girlfriend's (Michelle Williams) laptop, so his love life is in ruins too because she gets fired from the law firm representing Drake's company. Six months later, one of the company's scientists approaches Eddie hoping to get an expose on the evil things Drake is doing. Eddie sneaks into the headquarters, only to wind up a host for an alien symbiote that they found in outer space. He becomes Venom, a muscly, tentacly monster with a proclivity for biting heads off of living things (including people). Drake wants his alien back and has lots of resources, so mayhem ensues.The movie suffers a bit from tonal shifts. Sometimes it feels like a horror movie. Sometimes it feels like a comedy. Sometimes it's an action-adventure flick. Occasionally it flirts with Jekyll and Hyde moments. These various elements don't fit together smoothly. The advertising promised a darker anti-hero movie but this turns out to be a typical reluctant hero movie, of which there are tons of examples nowadays. On the other hand, Hardy gives a fine, twitchy performance as a mostly-loveable loser who has a hard time reining in his other, alien half. The special effects look great and the story moves along at a brisk pace. I just wish it had been riskier or had some substantial difference from other superhero movies.Slightly recommended.

        ",Mark Turner,4-Jan-19,Format: Blu-ray,4,"If you’re a fan of the Spider-man comic books then you know who Venom is. An alien at one time attached to Spider-man and then later transferred to tarnished news reporter Eddie Brock who blamed Spider-man for his lot in life. Thus he became the villain known as Venom. But most of that is abandoned for the movie version, VENOM, and it works well.A space shuttle owned by the Life Foundation is returning to Earth when something goes wrong. The shuttle crashes in Malaysia and all crew members save one are found dead. While being transported to a nearby hospital the sole survivor awakes, kills the ambulance crew and escapes on foot. Within the shuttle one container remained intact and is sent back to the home base for Life Foundation in San Francisco.Moving forward we find Brock (Tom Hardy) doing well for himself. He’s about to marry the woman of his dreams Ann Weying (Michelle Williams) who works as an attorney for the Life Foundation and who has helped him score an interview with the CEO of the company Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed). When Brock begins asking questions about human tests being done by the company the interview ends. The result is Drake ruining Brock’s life, taking away his job and firing Ann who leaves him.Tests were being done on humans. It seems the container held an alien symbiote, a creature that attaches itself to a host in order to remain alive. The problem is finding a suitable host to match the creature. Non-matched subjects result in a terrible death with the symbiote seeking a new host.Months later, down on his luck, cowering at the least sign of danger and drinking away his life Eddie is approached by Dr. Dora Skirth (Jenny Slate) who works for Life Foundation. Seeing the compulsive attitude and lack of care for life exhibited by Drake she wants to help Brock expose what’s taking place. She sneaks him into the research facility where Brock recognizes a homeless friend being used. Breaking her free it turns out the symbiote is inside of her but transfers to Brock. Taking over he helps him escape the guards.Confused and frightened Brock reaches out to Ann for help. Now dating a doctor they both attempt to find out what’s wrong with Brock having no clue about the symbiote. At the same time Drake and his black ops team are trying to find Brock as well. When push comes to shove the symbiote who calls himself Venom comes forward to protect Brock and take on the bad guys.While all of this is taking place remember the symbiote who escaped at the beginning of the film? It’s made its way to San Francisco as well. Its intent is to use Drake to get what it wants, a way off the planet to reach the rest of his race with the intent of taking over the planet. Guess who stands in his way?The movie works on a number of levels here. The setup is easily understood and the demarcation lines between bad guys and good guys are set. At the same time when Venom makes his presence known he becomes an anti-hero of sorts, feeding on the bad guys he takes on, most often biting off their heads. Guess it shows that it doesn’t pay to be a bad guy.But the movie has a unique combination of horror, action, comic book heroics and humor that works well and blends nicely. Brock complains and has no clue what’s going on as Venom sprouts forth and takes over to go hand to hand with the black ops members. He isn’t happy about being a repository for the creature either. But as the two combine and learn more about one another, as Venom helps heal the issues Brock has going on inside of him they come together to save the world or die trying. Venom even reveals something about himself I won’t disclose here that makes them a perfect match.There is little doubt that the main thing driving this film is the current interest in comic book based films combined with special effects that would not have been possible to film when the comics first created the character. Yes the effects are amazing. But let’s not forget that Hardy is an amazing actor and he brings to the Eddie Brock something we’ve not seen him do in the past. He makes the character not just human but funny at times. It makes for a more interesting character and Hardy makes it work spectacularly.A little bit of language will make this a movie that the smallest of children might want to bypass as well as the character being a bit frightening for tykes. But it’s a blast and a fun ride for everyone else and one to enjoy more than once.

The scientist smuggles Brock into the Foundation to take a look and he ends up getting infected by a symbiote calling itself Venom.The movie got panned by the critics but it actually isn’t that bad.If one pays attention to the opening they’ll hear Brock talk about the Tech companies in San Francisco taking over the city while the homeless population was exploding. That’s actually an underlying theme of the story with Life Foundation owner Carlton Drake played by Riz Ahmed representing the rich Tech giants using poor homeless people as guinea pigs in his experiments with the symbiotes.The special effects for Venom and the action scenes are well done. Where the film runs into problems is the interactions between Brock and Venom. Early on for example, Brock is feeling infected and jumps into a fish tank at a restaurant. Just a ridiculous sequence. Later on Brock and Venom act like friends, another bad choice in the script. It would have been better if they’d kept it to Brock constantly struggling for control.Overall, Venom is not as bad as the critics claimed.

        ",B&S About Movies,28-Dec-18,Format: Prime Video,2,"Directed by Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland, Gangster Squad), Venom has appeared on plenty of worst of lists this year. I held back judgment until I saw the movie. I can sum it up in one word: underwhelming. But after all, who was clamoring for a Venom movie after Spider-Man 3? Who was needing one in 2018? And after the magic of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, why do filmmakers feel they can still be so lazy with superheroes?That said, Venom is critic proof. After all, it was a box office success, ultimately earning $855 million worldwide, becoming the fifth highest-grossing film of 2018.It all comes down to one good thing: Tom Hardy. It's like this dude has to have the craziest voices in movies. His Eddie Brock voice is just the most need to please accent ever, while Venom, in his own words, is a ""James Brown lounge lizard."" The relationship between these two characters -- who become one person -- is the best part of the movie. Hardy also improvised a lot, such as when he jumps into a lobster tank to cool down. I kind of love that the dude was pretty much making up his own film. The actor claimed that he based his performance on Woody Allen, Conor McGregor and Redman.Everything else -- from the villains to Eddie Brock's relationships -- is as generic as it gets. Big points for having Jenny Slate in here, even if she does nothing. It's like the film felt it had to give us an origin when all we want to see is Venom break stuff. The end of the film, where he eats a criminal and meets Cletus ""Carnage"" Kasady (and come on, who doesn't want to watch Woody Harrelson against Hardy in a battle of accents and overacting) is exactly what everyone really wants, not nearly two hours of generic soldiers and Venom battling Elon Musk.In the spin of selling this movie, Columbia Pictures president Sanford Panitch claimed that ""Venom was considered a spin on a horror film, inspired by the works of John Carpenter and David Cronenberg, but with more pop and fun."" People that say these kinds of things have never seen films by these two directors. Get their words out of your mouth and make better movies.The hard part of this whole thing is that there's a tease of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, which will either make you say, ""I should have just watched that"" or ""Man, that was such a better movie.""

Let's be totally honest, of the 1.5 people that might actually read this, if you woke up with super powers tomorrow, would you do right all the time and never use those powers to your benefit?  Ironically, the comic book with the alien symbiote attached to the person felt more human that the comics that featured actual humansYes, it's a little fast paced.  And yes, they tried to force more into the movie than it would fit, but I personally still thought the movie was a lot of fun.  You don't get a whole lot of detail into the other characters and their relationships, but the movie isn't called ""The Misadventures of Dr. Skirth: I should have quit my job a long time ago"", it's called Venom.  And you get into the relationship between Eddie and Venom, and you get to see that Venom views the world in a very similar manner to a toddler.  He understands just enough to know what's happening, but all he really knows is that he is hungry.If I keep writing, I'm going to accidentally spoil some stuff.  The long and short of it, I guess, is it's worth a watch.

Sure a large percentage of the fan base nowadays are seeing these movies as they were favorite comics, cartoons,  video games growing up. However these movies aren't rated R so they definitely are making a choice for more ""corny"" humor instead of something only directed at adults.They also opted for a shorter format movie instead of the 2.5  hour ""norm"".  This means some build up / character development had to be rushed.  I wasn't a big fan of this but opted to just dive right into main plot concepts so it wasn't all bad.Special effects were cool and not ""cheap"" as some say.  Its amazing how people are critiquing on the internet what texture the symbiote should be.Tom hardy was great for the script he was given.  Some of the lines are just horrendously placed in terms of ""would he actually say that then""  but the kids laughed.All and all it was Venom and I loved it.

The actual running time is 1 and 1/2 hours with a mini teaser after four minutes of credits.  The rest of the time is for more credits followed by a brief cartoon of spider man who - I gather from other reviews - is somehow tied to Venom in the original graphic novels.  Tom Hardy was fantastic and the growing friendship between his character and Venom is funny.  I'm not a huge fan of car chase scenes but they didn't overwhelm the screen time so it was fine.

        ",Fabulinus,13-Jan-19,Format: Prime Video,4,"I've been only moderately impressed by the Marvel movies that have come out over the past 10 years.  Most of them are very light on dialog and equally light on acting (lol).  There have been a few exceptions like Iron Man, Thor Ragnarok, and Black Panther, but most are mediocre at best.  Venom, in my opinion, is one of the exceptions.  The acting in this (by all) was excellent, the story moved along at a good pace and it kept my attention straight through!  I thought the dialog of the venom character was a bit too silly, hence 4 stars instead of 5, but overall this was an excellent movie and well worth watching.  Even the title song by Eminem was excellent.  I'll most likely purchase this movie to watch again when I want to.

The soundtrack for the theater release, at least as listed in the credits at the end, was supposedly configured as Dolby Atmos. (I have a full Atmos and DTSX set up with all the bells and whistles.) However, as listed on the disc box, the Bluray disc is done in DTS HD Master Audio, with 5.1 channels. I find this rather odd for a disc this current. It should have been done in either DTSX (my processor converted the 5.1 to DTS Neural-X, at least) or Dolby Atmos. I assume the 4K release was done with Atmos or DTSX, but the Bluray disc could easily have been done this way, too. No big deal, but a limiting factor with this release.

        ",M. Evans,9-Jan-19,Format: Blu-ray,2,"Let me start by stating I dont write reviews very often, I dislike the idea of thinking what I have to say is important enough for the vast internet audience. Frankly I think the concept can become vain, everyone arguing opinions. However, there are times when something in my opinion needs to be explained from a factual, rational position. After viewing Venom and seeing the divide in reviews, I feel the need in this case to explain why some hate it and others, as most reviews here show, loved it.  Ok, I disliked this film, right out the gate. I wanted to like it, mind you. The last time we saw Venom on the screen, it was in the abysmal Spiderman 3 (I still love you Sam Raimi) played by the equally terrible Topher Grace. Ill say now NOTHING will be as bad as that rendition of Venom, so take a little comfort there. Let me explain why I disliked this version. Im a longtime Venom fan. Been reading the comics since I was 12, and Im 35 now, so I know his origins and character. I practically grew up with him and Spiderman. Venom was a villain. Eddie Brock was a criminal. He was a burglar and was prone to physical violence. I remember the beginning of the series Maximum Carnage, Brock was in prison at the time with Cletus Cassidy and thats how he met Carnage, not interviewing him. Brock and Venom killed many people in gruesome ways, and were always out for their own benefit, with the only exception being the few times Venom teamed up with Spidey, mostly to fight the greater evil, Carnage. In this film, Eddie Brock is more of pathetic loser turned antihero, a non-confrontational reporter fighting a crusade against the corporate powers. He seemed way to righteous and likeable, noble even at a certain point. The actual Venom thats been around for 20 years is NONE of those things. The film created a new character out of the framework of the original, and I thought it was vanilla cliche, boring and expected, predictable.  THAT is why I believe reviews are so split. Half the audience knows the Venom character already, the other half dont and are watching this new. Also, the pacing, dialog, character development, cinematography... were very sophomore. As others have stated, the film feels like film students put this together. Just a lack of anything fresh or creative. Tropes tropes tropes on top of cliches and formulaic narratives. Poo poo. It scares me films like this are sitting at 4 stars.

He is an average joe kind of guy who enjoys his life, but screws up when he goes to far while making an investigation in Carlton Drake's work. After six months, he is slightly depressed, but his life is jump started when he meets Venom. When Venom finally makes his way to Eddie for the first time, the movie really picks up to the point and it is great! The story could be a little better, but the best thing about the movie is Eddie and Venom's relationship (and no, not intimate or romantic, which I heard is what happened in the comics). Anne is an ok character, but wish she wasn't so over the top and dramatic about the things that occur in this movie...The actress needs to work on her scared acting..... Carlton is a very wooden and generic villain is who just in the movie to be evil with no real character feel to him. He is just in the movie to be an evil walking talking cheesy definition of an antagonist. On a positive note, Riot makes decent use of him! Riot is the best of the villainy part of this movie, who sadly does not have much screen time, but he is still an okay villain who feels like a character and villain who is also very frightening! Venom knows in this movie that Riot has more physical advantages than he does, but Venom is smart in a fight and has agility as an advantage, along with his strength, even though Riot is a little stronger. That fight in the end was awesome! Hardy nails Eddie and Venom and is the number one best thing about this entire film! I am glad the visuals and cgi holds up! If the cgi was bad, I could not take a bulky big Venom any more serious than the wussy scrawny ""Venom"" in SM3..... Many things in this movie could be done better and some done a little less, but Eddie makes everything work and worth it! I totally prefer this Eddie over some punk Eddie that was shown in the comics and 90s cartoon. I hope, with the $850m this movie won over, they make part 2 better!
